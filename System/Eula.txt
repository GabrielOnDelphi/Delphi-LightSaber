In this document, the current software is referred to as 'the product', the computer where the software and the license are installed is referred to as 'the computer'.
The developer of the product is referred to as 'the developer' or as 'the producer'.

The developer is willing to LICENSE the product to you ONLY UPON THE CONDITION THAT YOU ACCEPT ALL THE TERMS CONTAINED IN THIS BINARY CODE LICENSE AGREEMENT AND SUPPLEMENTAL LICENSE TERMS (COLLECTIVELY "AGREEMENT").
PLEASE READ THE AGREEMENT CAREFULLY. BY INSTALLING THIS SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT.
IF YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO BE BOUND BY ALL THE TERMS, PLEASE CLOSE THIS PROGRAM NOW.
RUNNING THIS SOFTWARE AT ANY TIME AND PLACE IMPLIES THAT YOU HAVE READ AND AGREED WITH THE LICENSE CONDITIONS STATED HERE.

GRANT OF LICENSE
The product and documentation accompanying this License, whether on disk, in memory, or on any other media (the "Software"), are licensed to you by the producer.
We retain title to the product and related documentation. The rights to use the license is of course locked to the original user/organization that initially acquired the license.

PERMITTED USES AND RESTRICTIONS
You may use the product according to the restrictions imposed by BETA MODE, TIME-LIMITED TRIAL USE, or REGULAR USE as described herein.
You may not decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, modify, rent, lease, loan, sublicense, distribute or create derivative works based upon the product in whole or part or transmit the product over a network or from one computer to another, or permit others to use the product through the Internet or similar mechanisms.
Your rights under this License will terminate automatically without notice from us if you fail to comply with any term(s) of this License and compensation will be required.
The product was not designed, tested and validated for medical use or another type of data processing that could result in loss/damage to human file or property.

TIME-LIMITED TRIAL USE
THE TIME-LIMITED TRIAL LICENSE MAY DISABLE CERTAIN FUNCTIONS OF THE SOFTWARE.
If you are using the product under a time-limited/trial license, you may use the product for evaluation and trial use purposes only on a single computer until the Expiration Date.
Upon trial expiration, you may not continue to use the product or to use the results for any purposes or to publish them without explicit permission. You are not allowed to bypass the trial protection mechanism!

LICENSE USAGE AND REDISTRIBUTION
The use of the product in REGULAR MODE requires a valid license for each computer that the product is used. For each License, you have purchased from us or an authorized distributor, you may install the product on a single computer, and make one copy (CD/DVD) of the product in machine-readable form for backup purposes.

At any point in time, the total number of concurrent users of the product is limited to the number of Single User Licenses or Concurrent User Licenses you purchased. For each License, you will be provided with an Unlock Key, which is valid for the original hardware configuration at the moment of installation.

The license is not transmissible and is bound to a single standard PC (not a server). Multiple users of the computer can use the license, but they cannot use the license simultaneously.
The license cannot be installed in shared (multi-terminal) systems or virtual machines. Using the software via a 'remote' connection to the computer is prohibited.

You need to obtain EXPLICIT permission before redistributing/reselling our products. The license, in this case, is sent directly to the end-user, not to the reseller!

LOST KEYS
The unlock key we provide you are tagged with your name. If your key leaves your computer (stolen due to negligence or if you specifically give it/borrow it to a 3rd party) and it becomes public, then it will be listed in our 'Stolen keys' database.
The product will refuse to work with a key listed in the 'Stolen keys' database, and we reserve the right to terminate the contract with you. Financial compensation may be required in this case.
We reserve the right not to grant additional license keys if we suspect illegitimate use of software/key.

UPDATES AND SUPPORT
The purchase of a License includes a limited period of technical support. Minor updates may be granted for free. Upgrades to the next major version ARE NOT free.

NON PAYMENTS AND DELAYS
The recommended interval for completing the payment process is 2 weeks. The maximum payment period is one month, unless this interval is clearly/explicitly changed by us. The customer will not delay the payment beyond this interval. In case the customer fails to complete the payment in time, or you only submit a partial payment, we reserve the right to terminate the contract with you. You are not allowed to use the product until the full payment is sent otherwise we may ask for interest or financial compensations calculated on a 'per day' basis. More details are available on our website.
The following items may not be guaranteed for customers that unnecessarily delay the payment: support, unlock keys, updates, software downloads.

COPYRIGHT
All copyrights related to the product and any copies thereof are owned by the producer. No rights, except the right to use the software (as explained in this document), transfer to you when you obtain a License.
By using our software you allow us to list your name (or your organization's name) on 'Our customers' page unless you contact us in written (emails are accepted) and specify that you want to withhold from this.

REFUND POLICY
If the product is distributed as Trial/Demo software, it implies that before acquisition you tested the product and at the moment of acquisition you are aware of the features provided within and the way how the product performs. On our website, we strongly encourage the customers to test our software before purchasing it. Therefore, after the acquisition of the product, we guaranty NO refund! In case we accept to make a refund, taxes that we had to honor (3rd parties, local taxes, costs for CD, mailing, support, manual processing of forms and papers, partners and reseller royalties, discounts, etc) are NOT refunded.

TERMINATION
We may terminate the right to use the product on notice to you (which may be delivered electronically by the same means as the license for the product is distributed), and you may terminate this License at any time by uninstalling, erasing and destroying your copy of the product and related items (data, license keys, user manual, etc). Upon termination of this License, you must discontinue all use of the product. No refunds will be granted in case of contract termination.

BETA MODE
In Pre-Release and Beta mode there is no warranty AT ALL about the quality of the behavior and data/results produced by the product. These modes are intended only to show you the capabilities of the product. In this mode, the product might contain undocumented bugs. We assume *NO* responsibilities at all for this mode. You are not allowed to use the results of a beta version.

BUG REPORTS
Bug reports are necessary to provide the ever-increasing quality of the product.
In case of program malfunction (internal errors, crashes, etc) the program may send malfunction-related data to us (usually program internal state at the moment of malfunction). The report may or may not contain also a screenshot. The report may contain user-identifiable data (whatever is visible in the screenshot, IP address, etc). Except the above-mentioned information, no particular/private files (for example your private files in "My Documents") will be sent to us! We value your privacy. Whatever data you choose to send to us, remains with us and nobody else. User-identifiable data will under no circumstances be made public or shared with 3rd parties! We are not Facebook! If you don't want to submit bug reports you can list the product into Windows firewall's 'Blocked programs'. The bug report is usually deleted after the bug has been investigated and solved, or when it becomes obsolete (for example, when we release a new version, old bug reports are discarded). We may notify the customers when the bug has been fixed.
We encourage the user to let the program to send the bug reports to us. If the user opt not to send the bug reports, the malfunction-related data may be insufficient to fix the bug. Therefore, NO SUPPORT is guaranteed in this case.
