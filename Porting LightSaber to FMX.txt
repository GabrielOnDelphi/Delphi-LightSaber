With some work, I made the Core package platform agnostic. 
This means that you can use it both VCL and FMX projects. 
This is a breaking change. Your code will not compile anymore. 
However, in less than 5 minutes, with some batch replace, you will be back online.

The following changes were made: 

1. The new library was moved to a new branch.
Fix: Use this new branch to download the code. 

2. Some files were moved into the Core packages and their prefix was changed from 'cb' to 'cc'.
cbAppData.pas
cbEncodeCRC.pas
cbEncodeMime.pas
cbEncodeXOR.pas
cbLogLinesAbstract.pas
cbLogLinesM.pas
cbLogLinesS.pas
cbLogRam.pas
cbLogTypes.pas
cbLogUtils.pas
cbMath.pas
cbMRU.pas
cbPascal.pas
cbPlatformFile.pas
cbRttiSetToString.pas
cbStrBuilder.pas
cbStringList.pas
cbStringListA.pas
cbWrapString.pas
Fix: You can apply a batch replace to fix this.

3. 'cb' files were moved from root to the "LightSaber\FrameVCL\" folder. 
The fmx were moved to the "LightSaber\FrameFMX\" folder.
Fix: Add this new folder to your "Search paths" or "Library paths".

4. AppData was split into three classes:
  TAppDataCore                  (platform agnostic)
        ->  TAppData            (for VCL)
        ->  TAppDataFMX         (for FMX)
Fix: Nothing to change here. The old code will work. 
        
5. The global var AppData is now of TAppData.
Fix: Nothing to change here. The old code will work because the class name remains the same.
