The creation order of FMX forms and the sequence of constructors/events called:

    Create - The constructor of the form is called.
    Loaded - This method is called after the form and its components are loaded.
    CreateWnd - Called when the window handle for the form is created.
    CreateWindowHandle - Called as part of CreateWnd to create the actual window handle.
    SetParent - The parent of the form is set, and this can be called multiple times during the form's lifecycle.
    AfterConstruction - Called after the form's constructor has finished executing.
    FormInitialize - A custom method provided by TLightForm that allows initialization after the form is fully created.
    Show - The form is shown if the Show parameter is True.

The sequence for dynamic creation, DFM streaming, and other scenarios can be summarized as follows:

    Dropping control on a form:
        Create
        AfterConstruction
        SetParent
        CreateWnd
        CreateWindowHandle
        CreateWnd post
        SetParent post

    Executing the program (DFM streaming):
        Create
        AfterConstruction
        SetParent
        SetParent post
        SetParent
        SetParent post
        Loaded
        CreateWnd
        CreateWindowHandle
        CreateWnd post

    Dynamic creation of the control:
        Create
        AfterConstruction
        SetParent
        CreateWnd
        CreateWindowHandle
        CreateWnd post
        SetParent post
